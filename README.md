This is a scraper created for the Online Coins of the Roman Empire (OCRE) site. The idea is to scrape coin images and metadata so that they can be utilised for GAN-related training or GAN reconstructions.

Install using the requirements.txt file.

To use, you will need to run queries on the numismatics.org/ocre and download the query files. Then, put those files in the data folder in this project. You can then run the /src/scape/scrape_coins.py file to scrape non-British Museum sites. To scrape the British Museum coin data, use scrpe_BM in the same folder.  You can run the software by using the python command without additional inputs but you need the search files set in the data folder. Python scrape_coins.py should work on the command line.
