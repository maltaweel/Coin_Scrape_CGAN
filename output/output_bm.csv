"No: 1904,1102.2","Gold choker necklace.  The necklace consists of three strands of simple, single loop-in-loop construction. The three chains are firmly soldered at each end into a bar with three deep sockets, gold tubes of barrel-shaped form, with convex sides and border mouldings.  The end bars are provided with a hook and eye fastening, also neatly and robustly made.  The eye is made from a folded single thick gold wire with curled ends.  There is a spacer element, designed to match the clasp assembly, with three barrel-shaped tubes that can move freely on the chains.  In wear, this spacer would have ensured that the chains formed tidy parallel rows with no twisting or overlapping.  The necklace is both well-designed and well-made.",,00096007_001.jpg
"No: 1980,0225.1","Panel under a pointed arch carved in relief with two episodes from the Dīpaṃkara Jātaka. 
On the far left a small figure with long hair and on top a short horizontal length, looped and secured across the middle with one end pointing up, wearing a girdled paridhāna and uttarīya, turns towards the central figure and holds an opening lotus by its stalk in his right hand. He appears to be a young brāhmaṇa ascetic. In front of him a long-haired old brāhmaṇa ascetic, bearded, with a similar loop of hair on top and an uttarīya, joins his hands in the direction of the Buddha. Behind the monk in front is another brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair, carved almost on the scale of the Buddha; and beyond the Buddha, again behind a monk, the very large head and torso of a young brāhmaṇa ascetic with long hair and the same style of hair on top as the other brāhmaṇas. Beside the Buddha are three monks in all, two with hands joined and right shoulder bare and one holding a lotus bud by its stalk in one hand, the robe in another and having both shoulders covered. Two appear to have one of the three monastic garments folded over the left shoulder, as in Eastern Indian, Sri Lankan and South-east Asian representations, and marked with rectangles representing the patches of cloth from which monastic garments were prescriptively made, features exceedingly rare in Gandhāra sculpture. In the centre the haloed and dominating Buddha stands almost in three-quarter view with moustache and densely linear hair with the uṣṇīṣa a large bun-chignon bound with a plain band. He raises the open right hand at right angles to the chest and secures the robe with the left hand. Both shoulders are covered and the drapery folds, as on the robes of the three monks, are defined by dense grooves, sometimes overlapping or crossing in a disorganised manner. Beyond the monks and at the far right, corresponding to the lotus-holding ascetic in the opposite corner, stands a woman with tunic, a paridhāna with girdle round it and a scarf running in the narrow mode from the left shoulder. Her hair forms a tall loop, and she wears earrings, anklets and a collar and holds a large opening lotus by its stalk in her left hand. What appears to be a prostrate figure before the Buddha can scarcely be made out except as a broken curved outline of the back, a slightly more defined head and one distinguishable elbow.
Apart from the fact that the Buddha's face has open eyes with a narrow ring of lids and incised pupils, the heads of the other figures are very similar, long to oval, with mechanical modelling, even where the monks' leanness is conveyed in sharp noses and chins and chisel marks, and the eyes are large, rounded and protruding, only rarely showing lids. The effect, perhaps partly due to wear, is of a staring remoteness, also seen in the Buddha.
The young ascetic on the left is, like the prostrate figure below the Buddha, perhaps Megha. They would thus form a scene in continuous narration and, while the position and appearance of the young woman on the far right readily suggest a donor, she may be Prakṛti and the whole composition could then be an early representation of the Dīpaṃkara story, despite the appearance of ascetics, unexplained in this context, unless they are connected with the presence of a fellow student of the Bodhisattva.
The border encloses between fillets an undulating stalk with regular nodes from which stalks branch carrying open lotuses and one bud and one leaf seen from the side. The open lotuses have centrally grooved petals and stamens; at the apex is a small open lotus.",,00278513_001.jpg

"No: 1928,0709.4","Iron Lorica Squamata (scale-armour) fragments. A fragment consisting of five rows of overlapping scales. Each scale is of rectangular shape with a convex lower edge. The scales in the upper four rows have a double perforation at the top, base, and at each side. The lowest row comprises larger scales of the same type, but without the perforations at the lower edge. Each scale overlaps that adjacent to it, and the base of each row overlaps the top of the row beneath. The scales are secured to one another by coiled wire ties passing through the perforations. The large scales measure 4.1 cm by c. 3.2 cm, the smaller scales 3.8 cm by c. 2.4 cm. When deposited the fragment was folded inwards which has resulted in the present double thickness of armour, revealing the inner, not outer, face of the scales.",,00743706_001.jpg
